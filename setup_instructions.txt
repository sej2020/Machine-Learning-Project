In order to use this repository, you should follow a couple steps:

    Install the requirements listed in the requirements.txt

    Navigate to <repo_location>/AutoML/ScikitLearn/parSim_v5/main.py

    This main file is where you can modify the parameters for the package

    The primary parameter of interest is the 'datapath':
        Set it to the location of a csv with the target variable in the final column
        For a quick trial, set it to '<repo_location>/AutoML/Concrete_Data/Concrete_Data.csv'

    Once you are satisfied with the parameters for the run, simply run the main file

    It will use the utility function located in utils.py and run many ML models over your input data

    Figures on the model output will be written to your filesystem, and information about execution will be fed to stdout
