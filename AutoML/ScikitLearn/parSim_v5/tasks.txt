----------


Connecting to Website:

    Learn Madhavan's Tech Stack
    Set up database with Docker
    Add event listeners and event handlers


AutoML:

    Run large-scale experiment
        X - Port code to Quartz
        - Save timing details and experiment metadata
        - Create visualization & identify optimal n_workers
        - Create profile report on final program

    X - Make boxplot() functional

    Parametrize EVERYTHING
        X - Train/Test size in data_split
        X - CV Folds
        X - Regressor names
        - maybe n_processors
        X - matplotlib boxplot themes
        X - dpi
        X - n_vizualized for test_best
        - formatting options for table
        - kill time
        - download or email - csv or json format

    Spruce up graphics w/ matplotlib styling

    Refactor performance metrics (make exclusively scipy and / or implement metrics ourselves)

    X - Test program on different datasets

    Work on saving model / loading model

    Use Pathlib w/ PurePaths for linux / mac / windows priority

    X - Roll up for loops if it is nicer

    Add comments everywhere

    Make this a distributable package
        - Remove unnecessary code
        - Create requirements.txt
        - Test it on other systems
        - Package / publish it?


Paper:

    OpenCV

    User-centric comparison of libraries on MNIST
        - max amount of abstraction offered by the library
        - max amount of flexibility offered by the library
        - run times
    
    Tables
        - Regressors
        X - activation functions
        - evaluation metrics
        - layer types
        - optimizer
        - loss functions

    OLS
        - Understand various solvers
        - Come up with ideas for B-datasets
        - Generate those datasets
        - and then, implement experiments
