What should this program even do?

Processing objectives:
    Real time - 
        a. read in metadata.yaml
        b. read in actual_time.yaml (rows, nanoseconds recorded)
        c. add to df

    Theoretical time - 
        a. read in theoretical_time.yaml (rows, theoretical flops)
        b. take MFLOPS from benchmark to create expected time
        c. add expected time to df next to real time for each reg and rows

    Memory - 
        a. use memray transform csv command to process each .bin file programmatically
        b. parse resulting csv files, record total memory usage for each csv reg and row count
        c. add mem usage to same df as other, should have three columns for each regressor
