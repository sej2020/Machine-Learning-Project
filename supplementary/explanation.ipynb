    "Several visualizations for model comparison are produced automatically when a request is processed. The first of these is a boxplot, displaying model performance on every cross-validation fold during CV training. Each box represents a regressor, and a boxplot is created for each of the 13 metrics that our web service supports for evaluation of model performance. This same cross-validation information can also be displayed as a bar graph, with the training performance of the regressor displayed on the y-axis, and the fold number displayed on the x-axis"
