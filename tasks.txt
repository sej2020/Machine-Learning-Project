Task List
----------

Experiment Framework
    4. Confidence interval around 2D datavis

    5. Grouped barchart for runtimes by platform

    6. Containerize environment for this w/ Docker

    7. 3D vis of some data?

    9. Meta-script to analyze time complexity of variably sized data

    10. Memory profiling :(

    11. Reset counter, little cleanup utility



Web Service:
    1. Write a short paragraph about our team and work
        - should include links to webpages and github
        - roadmap for future of website
        - link and describe our related work
    
    2. Look into options for data centric error band visualization (Sam & Josh)

    3. Pickle best model to embed on webpage
        - should be able to return to use model based on request id

    4. Set limit on k folds on backend - error if k > n, where n is rows

    5. Put together a list of all exciting new visualization ideas

    6. Make dispatch function to handle different output types (AI params, data size vs model accuracy plotting, future work, etc)

    7. Make modified comparison function that runs k-fold cv for many values k to determine if more data = better results

    

    


Research Paper:

    1. visminmaxplot added to LaTeX doc

    2. Lst Sqrs literature review (Sam & Josh)

    X - 4. Ellipsoid Experiment (Sam & Josh) 
        - generate data
        - conduct experiment
            - think about adherence to big-O bounds
        - visualize appropriately
        - record Experiment and insert into LaTex doc

    6. Beta Data Experiments (Sam & Josh) 
        - choose which dataset concepts to test
        - generate data
        - conduct experiment
        - visualize appropriately
        - record Experiment and insert into LaTex doc

    7. Add tables to describe libraries (Sam)
        - Regressors
        X - activation functions
        - evaluation metrics
        - layer types
        - optimizers (need Josh to locate optimizers in OpenCV before I can mark complete)
        - loss functions


In Future:
    Allow requests to run concurrently
    ReIntroduce TestBest pipeline
    Use heuristic/new model to give user information on which models/regressors to deploy for which data
    Ensemble Model
    Report to go along with results
    Embed a model in the webpage
    Make visualization package
