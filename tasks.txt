Task List for Week 2/27
----------


Web Service:
    X - 1. Write disclaimers and instructions for user data (Sam & Josh)
        - size: 10,000x100. maybe test to see how big of a csv file that is and tell Madhavan 8MB
        - type: no categorical data
        - content: do not submit sensitive data
        - order: single label  and label must be far righthand side of table
        - headers: can be included or excluded
        - Nan: no Nans allows
        - specify missing data will cause a lot of regressors to fail

    2. Raise Errors in pipeline (Josh)
        - trace function calls, line of error, and specific error
        - come up with error code and share with Madhavan
        - function should return information on why data failed

    3. Return dictionary with information about which regressors failed and why (Josh)

    4. Come up with groupings for regressors to add option to front end (Sam & Josh)

    5. Data Validation Pipeline (Sam)
        - check for size
        - check for categorical data
        - check for missing values
        - check for NaNs

    5.5. Data Imputation (Sam)
        - decide method
        - build pipeline
        - include new warning/instructions

    6. Look into options for data centric error band visualization (Sam & Josh)

    


Research Paper:

    1. Look into errors thrown by circle data script (Sam & Josh) 
        - plot data and lines for each library on one graphic

    2. Read articles Dr. Kurban sent us (Sam & Josh) 

    3. Lst Sqrs literature review (Sam & Josh)

    4. Elipsoid Experiment (Sam & Josh) 
        - generate data
        - conduct experiment
        - visualize appropriately
        - record Experiment and insert into LaTex doc

    5. Look into Curse of Dimensionality (Sam & Josh) 

    6. Beta Data Experiments (Sam & Josh) 
        - choose which dataset concepts to test
        - generate data
        - conduct experiment
        - visualize appropriately
        - record Experiment and insert into LaTex doc

    7. Add tables to describe libraries (Sam)
        - Regressors
        X - activation functions
        - evaluation metrics
        - layer types
        - optimizers (need Josh to locate optimizers in OpenCV before I can mark complete)
        - loss functions


In Future:
    Allow requests to run concurrently
    ReIntroduce TestBest pipeline
    Use heuristic/new model to give user information on which models/regressors to deploy for which data
    Ensemble Model
    Report to go along with results
    Embed a model in the webpage
    Make visualization package
