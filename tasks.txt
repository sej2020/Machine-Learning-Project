    X - Test program on different datasets

    Work on saving model / loading model

    X - Roll up for loops if it is nicer

    X - Add comments everywhere

    Make this a distributable package

    Flesh out exception object for error emails, give tracebacks

    Use modern sqlalchemy (or don't, who knows)


Paper:

    X - OpenCV

    User-centric comparison of libraries on MNIST
        - max amount of abstraction offered by the library
        - max amount of flexibility offered by the library
        - run times
    
    Tables
        - Regressors
        X - activation functions
        - evaluation metrics
        - layer types
        - optimizer
        - loss functions

    OLS
        X - Understand various solvers
        X - Come up with ideas for B-datasets
        - Generate those datasets
        - and then, implement experiments
