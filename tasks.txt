Task List for Week 2/27
----------

Experiment Framework
    X - 1. Barchart for accuracy metrics
        - MAE
        - MSE
        - RMSE
        - R2

    X - 2. Barchart for runtimes

    X - 3. 2D data plotted with a regression line on top

    4. Confidence interval around 2D datavis

    5. Grouped barchart for runtimes by platform

    6. Containerize environment for this w/ Docker

    7. 3D vis of some data?

    X - 8. Save output and metadata to autogenerated folders

    9. Meta-script to analyze time complexity of variably sized data

    10. Memory profiling :(



Web Service:
    X - 1. Write disclaimers and instructions for user data (Sam & Josh)
        - size: 10,000x100. maybe test to see how big of a csv file that is and tell Madhavan 8MB
        - type: no categorical data
        - content: do not submit sensitive data
        - order: single label  and label must be far righthand side of table
        - headers: can be included or excluded
        - Nan: no Nans allows
        - specify missing data will cause a lot of regressors to fail

    X - 2. Raise Errors in pipeline (Josh)
        - trace function calls, line of error, and specific error
        - come up with error code and share with Madhavan
        - function should return information on why data failed

    X - 3. Return dictionary with information about which regressors failed and why (Josh)

    X - 4. Come up with groupings for regressors to add option to front end (Sam & Josh)
        - Forbidden estimators list should now be dead so remove it

    X - 5. Data Validation Pipeline (Sam)
        - check for size
        - check for categorical data
        - check for missing values
        - check for NaNs

    X - 6. Data Cleaning (Sam)
        X - standardizing
        X - imputation

    7. Write a short paragraph about our team and work
        - should include links to webpages and github
        - roadmap for future of website
        - link and describe our related work
    
    8. Look into options for data centric error band visualization (Sam & Josh)

    9. Pickle best model to embed on webpage
        - should be able to return to use model based on request id

    10. 

    


Research Paper:

    1. Look into errors thrown by circle data script (Sam & Josh) 
        X - plot data and lines for each library on one graphic
        - add vizminmaxpoints experiment results to LaTex doc

    2. Lst Sqrs literature review (Sam & Josh)

    3. Create Experiment Pipeline
        - accuracy
        - time
        - space
        - viz

    4. Elipsoid Experiment (Sam & Josh) 
        - generate data
        - conduct experiment
            - think about adherence to big-O bounds
        - visualize appropriately
        - record Experiment and insert into LaTex doc

    5. Look into Curse of Dimensionality (Sam & Josh) 

    6. Beta Data Experiments (Sam & Josh) 
        - choose which dataset concepts to test
        - generate data
        - conduct experiment
        - visualize appropriately
        - record Experiment and insert into LaTex doc

    7. Add tables to describe libraries (Sam)
        - Regressors
        X - activation functions
        - evaluation metrics
        - layer types
        - optimizers (need Josh to locate optimizers in OpenCV before I can mark complete)
        - loss functions


In Future:
    Allow requests to run concurrently
    ReIntroduce TestBest pipeline
    Use heuristic/new model to give user information on which models/regressors to deploy for which data
    Ensemble Model
    Report to go along with results
    Embed a model in the webpage
    Make visualization package
